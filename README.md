## General Information

- Lending Club case study gives the details about the urban customers and their behavior of loan repayment. It shows when a company receives set of applications for the loan, on what basis they are to be approved or rejected. 

Risks Associated:
If a member is likely to repay the loan, then company deciding not to give the loan. This leads to loss for the company. 
If a member is defaulter, then still company decides to give the loan on certain reasons. That also leads to financial loss to the company. 
- Loan dataset is given by upgrad. Based on that data further analysis is done.

## Conclusions
- Customers with Loans that have lesser tenures tend to pay fully which is least possible loss-making cause for the company. 
- Customers who have their own house can be preferred to provide a loan, as observed they are the ones who are least defaulted customers among others.
- Customers who are taking loan for the purpose of clearing their debts are more likely to go default. So company should verify the exact purpose of the loan to proceed with the process.
- Customers with verified sources are less likely to default their loans.
